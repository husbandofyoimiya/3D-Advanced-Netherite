# 3D-Advanced-Netherite
A resource pack from Minecraft for the mod Advanced Netherite

Description:
This pack provides full PBR (Physically Based Rendering) support for all tools, armor, items, and blocks added by the Advanced Netherite mod. Textures feature reflective properties and normal/height maps for realistic depth and shine under supported shaders. All artwork is a direct 4x upscale (128x resolution) of the original mod assets, preserving the original style while enhancing visual fidelity without adding unnecessary detail or impacting performance significantly.

Compatibility:
Primarily developed and tested for Minecraft 1.20.1 with the corresponding mod version, but theoretically supports all existing mod versions. Compatibility with other mod versions depends on whether the mod author changes texture names or structure in future updates.
